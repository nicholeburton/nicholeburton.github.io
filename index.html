      Rilakkuma is a fictional character produced by the Japanese company <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San-X' target='_blank'>San-X</a>,created by former employee Aki Kondo. Rilakkuma is a combination of the Japanese words "rilakkusu" (meaning relax) and "kuma" (meaning bear) to roughly mean "relaxed bear". Rilakkuma is indeed always relaxed, and often appears with his friend <a href=''>Korilakkuma</a>.
